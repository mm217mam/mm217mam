- Hi, I’m Mike Montes @mm217mam.
- It's been a year since I opened this repositiry and it's time to start filling it.  I obtained my B.S. in Data Science in Decmeber 2023, and am now halfway thorugh the M.S. with concentrations on ML and Big Data.  Those don't limit me though.  It is now time for me to start showing what I've learned: I'll start with easy datasets and show my coding skills in R, Python and SQL, and then I'll move onto more demanding projects.  If you're new to DS, ask me questions if you need help as I've struggled quite a bit and I want to smooth your way down this interesting path. 
- I’m interested in learning to use data science to solve our problems and sometimes just answer, "What if...?"
- I’m currently learning Machine Learning, Probability II online at Maryville U of St. Louis
- I've taken Python, R, predictive modeling and SAS.  (I'm halfway through taking 12 hours in the spring so my GitHub may grow slowly.)
- I’m looking to collaborate on learning to code and navigate the pro network with my fellow noobs.
- How to reach me: miguel.montes.jr@gmail.com

Short Background:
- B.S. Chemistry UTEP (TX)
- Two years doctoral studies at UTMB Galveston in biophysics & biochemistry (protein expression, purification, crystallization and structure determination via XRC.)
- Currently a high school science teacher in TX.
- Programmed in Basic long ago - still have my TRS-80.

- Looking to learn efficiently so this profile to be altered as I learn the ropes to engage with you fine people.

I like to but don't always get to:
- play tennis
- play sax and piano and listen to jazz and classical
- read sci-fi (Asimov, of course)
- game (Cities Skylines)
