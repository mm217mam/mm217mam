- Hi, I’m Mike Montes @mm217mam.
- I’m interested in learning to use data science to solve our problems and sometimes just answer, "What if...?"
- I’m currently learning Python, R, predictive modeling and ML online at Maryville U., St. Louis.  (Taking 12 hours in the spring so my GitHub may grow slowly.)
- I’m looking to collaborate on learning to code and navigate the pro network with my fellow noobs.
- How to reach me: miguel.montes.jr@gmail.com

Short Background:
- B.S. Chemistry UTEP (TX)
- Some graduate work at UTMB in biophysics & biochemistry (protein expression, purification, crystallization and structure determination via XRC.)
- Currently a high school science teacher in TX.
- Programmed in Basic long ago - still have my TRS-80.

- Looking to learn efficiently so this profile to be altered as I learn the ropes to engage with you fine people.

I like to but don't always get to:
- play tennis
- play sax and piano and listen to jazz and classical
- read sci-fi (Asimov, of course)
- game (Cities Skylines)
